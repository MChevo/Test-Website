                <p>Sadistic and cunning, Thresh is a restless spirit who prides himself on tormenting
                    mortals and breaking them with slow, excruciating inventiveness. His victims suffer far beyond the
                    point of death, for Thresh wreaks agony upon their souls, imprisoning them in his lantern to torture
                    for all eternity.</p>
                <p>In an age history has all but forgotten, the man who would later be known as Thresh
                    was once a member of an order devoted to gathering and protecting knowledge. The masters of this
                    order tasked him with guarding a hidden underground vault filled with dangerous and corrupted
                    magical artifacts. Thresh was incredibly strong-willed and methodical, which made him well-suited to
                    such work.</p>
                <p>The vault Thresh guarded was buried deep beneath the citadel at the center of an
                    island chain and protected by runic sigils, arcane locks and potent wards. Spending such time in the
                    presence of dark spells began to affect Thresh as the magic sought out his innate malice. For years
                    the relics preyed on his insecurities, taunting him with his deepest fears and feeding his
                    bitterness.</p>
                <p>Thresh’s spite surfaced through wanton acts of cruelty, as his talent for exploiting
                    vulnerability bloomed. He slowly tore pages out of a living book, binding it back together when it
                    was all but spent. He scratched the glass of a mirror bound with the memory of an ancient mage until
                    it was opaque, trapping the man in darkness, only to polish it anew and repeat. Just as a secret
                    wants to be told, a spell wants nothing more than to be cast, and Thresh denied this each day. He
                    would start to recite an incantation, then let the words trickle off his tongue, halting just before
                    the last syllable.</p>
                <p>He became exquisitely skilled at covering all evidence of his cruelty, such that no
                    one in the order suspected he was anything other than a disciplined guard. The vault had grown so
                    vast that no one knew its contents as completely as Thresh, and the lesser artifacts faded from the
                    order’s memory, as did Thresh himself.</p>
                <p>He resented that he had to hide his meticulous work. Everything under his watch was
                    evil, or corrupted in some way - why shouldn’t he be free to do as he would?</p>
                <p>The vault held many peculiar magical artifacts but no people, until one day when a
                    chained man was dragged into the sunken catacombs. He was a warlock who had infused his body with
                    raw sorcery, which gave him the power to regenerate his flesh, no matter how grievous the wound.</p>
                <p>Thresh was delighted at his new ward - a being who could feel the full range of human
                    suffering, but would not perish, a plaything he could torment for years to come. He started
                    methodically separating the warlock’s skin from his flesh with a hook, and used his chains to lash
                    and tear the open wound until it healed. He took to wearing the chains as he patrolled the vault,
                    reveling in the warlock’s fear at the long, dragging sound of his approach.</p>
                <p>With ample charges to torment in the vault, Thresh became even more distanced from the
                    order above. He began to take his meals in his underground chamber lit by a single lantern, rarely
                    emerging from the catacombs. His skin developed a pallid complexion from lack of sunlight, and his
                    face became gaunt and hollow. Members of the order avoided him, and when a series of mysterious
                    disappearances plagued the order, none thought to investigate Thresh’s lair.</p>
                <p>When the disaster known as the Ruination struck, magical shockwaves claimed the lives
                    of all who lived on the isles and transformed them into a state of undeath. While others screamed in
                    anguish, Thresh reveled in the ruin. He rose from this cataclysm as a spectral abomination, but
                    unlike many who have passed into the shadow world, Thresh did not lose his identity. Rather, his
                    penchant for cruel torture and ability to discern weakness was only heightened.</p>
                <p>He relished the chance to continue his cruelty without fear of reprisal, unfettered by
                    the limits of mortality. As a wraith, Thresh could torment the living and the dead endlessly,
                    delighting in their despair before claiming their soul for an eternity of suffering.</p>
                <p>Thresh now seeks only particular victims: the most clever and resilient, and those
                    with a strong will. His greatest joy comes from tormenting his victims until they lose any last
                    glimmer of hope, before facing the inevitable hook of his chains.</p>
